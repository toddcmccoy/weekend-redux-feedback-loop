# Get that Feedback



## Description

_Duration: 18 Hours_

The goal of the project was to create a simple, yet stylish, feedback form. The result allows the user to give feedback in three categories: how they are feeling today; how well they are understanding the material; and how supported they feel. The use also has an option to leave comments before submitting their feedback.

The feedback form in the most basic mode gives the user a chance to review their feedback before submitting. Additional functionality allows them to go back and edit their submissions should they change their mind before they submit the feedback.


### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `prime_feedback`,
2. The queries in the `data.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage
How does someone use this application? Tell a user story here.

1. Answer the feedback questions honestly.

2. Each question lists a one to five rating scale that should be helpful in accurately calculating your response.

3. Add any clarifying comments you feel are appropriate.

4. You will have a chance to go back and change your answers before you submit.

5. Submit your feedback and enjoy the rest of your day.

## Acknowledgement

Thanks to [Prime Digital Academy](www.primeacademy.io) who equipped and helped me to make this application a reality. Thank you especially to my instructor, Liz, and my Jemisin Cohort ðŸŒŠ team. I was going to list every cohort member that personally helped me on portions of this project and other projects during Redux week, but once I hit 9 of 12 I figured it would be easier to just list the cohort.
